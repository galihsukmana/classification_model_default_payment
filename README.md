## Introduction
In this project, I developed a supervised learning model to tackle the task of How to classify credit card default based on the features. The model utilizes any algorithms and is trained on a labeled dataset to learn patterns and make accurate predictions. The goal of this project is to predict customer credit card default or not default payment.

## Dataset
The model was trained using a labeled dataset called h8dsft_P1M1_galih_s.csv. The dataset consists of customers behavior, such as number of instances, features, and target variable.

## Installation
To run this project locally, please follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository: `git clone git@github.com:galihsukmana/classification_model_default_payment.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
To use the trained model for making predictions, follow these steps:
1. Load the pre-trained model weights
2. Preprocess the input data
3. Make predictions using the model


## Results
This model is for my first classification exercise to compare any performa from each algorithms.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you find any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Let's collaborate and make this project even better!
